## Dataset

### CORA

The Cora dataset consists of `2708` scientific publications classified into one of `7` classes:

- `Case_Based`
- `Genetic_Algorithms`
- `Neural_Networks`
- `Probabilistic_Methods`
- `Reinforcement_Learning`
- `Rule_Learning`
- `Theory`

Each publication in the dataset is described by a `0/1`-valued word vector indicating the absence/presence of the corresponding word from the dictionary. The dictionary consists of `1433` unique words. The citation network consists of `5429` links.

## Problem Statement

The objective is to develop a machine learning approach to predict the subjects of scientific papers.
